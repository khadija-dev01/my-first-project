          <b>Khadija Niazi</b><br><br>
          I am Khadija Niazi‚Äîan Afghan girl with big dreams and an unshakable faith.
I come from a place where hope is a choice, and I choose it every single day.
With a heart full of purpose and a mind set on growth, I walk the path of knowledge, compassion, and resilience.
Whether I am teaching languages, learning to code, or chasing the light of wisdom, I do it with love, discipline, and trust in God.
My journey is not easy, but it is mine-and I walk it with pride, courage, and a deep desire to one day uplift others, especially the girls of my homeland.<br>
<b>This is more than a website.
This is a piece of my soul.</b>

    <h2>My Future Goals</h2>
    <p>
      The future I dream of is not just for me-it is for every girl who was told she couldn‚Äôt.
      I want to become a skilled programmer, fluent in multiple languages, and a strong, independent woman who shapes her own destiny.
      My goal is to work with global tech companies like Microsoft or Google, not just to succeed, but to prove that with faith, effort, and courage, anything is possible.
      Along the way, I want to empower girls from my homeland-those with dreams, but without the chance-to believe in themselves and rise.
      I believe that true success is not measured only by personal gain, but by how many lives you touch with the light you carry.
      This journey is just beginning, and I am walking it with purpose, hope, and trust in God.</p>
